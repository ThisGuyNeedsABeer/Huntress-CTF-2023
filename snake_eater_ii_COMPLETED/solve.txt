Solution:

1. Download and extract the attachment
2. We can ascertain by the file icon this is also a PyInstaller similar to Snake Eater I.
3. Decompoiling the code with PyInsxtractor: https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor we see this code is also protected with PyArmor
4. Running the file in a VM watching with Procmon we can see flag.txt being dropped in AppData
5. On subsequent runs, the path changes, and a flag.txt is created in another random path and then deleted rapidly.
	a. C:\Users\VM\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\UXP\PluginsStorage\PHSP\24\Internal\com.adobe.ccx.comments-webview\flag.txt
6. Since the flag was being deleted from disk, but not zero'd or wrote over from what I could tell I recovered the file
7. I had Recuva scan the last path that I saw the flag.txt drop and was able to pull it back
	a. Scanning: C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\UXP\PluginsStorage\PHSP\24\Internal\com.adobe.ccx.comments-webview\
	b. Found flag.txt
8. Flag: flag{be47387ab77251ecf80db1b6725dd7ac}
