Multi-Challenge: M Three Sixty Five
Category: Miscellaneous
Difficulty: easy
Author: David Carter
Description: 

1. For this challenge, you can connect into a PowerShell Core instance. Note that this is running out of a Linux-based Docker container, so you do not have a full-blown Windows operating system or pure PowerShell.

Connect with SSH, with username user and SSH password userpass.

When you connect to the session for the very first time, you will be authenticated into a Microsoft 365 environment. WARNING: Once you disconnect, you will need to restart your container to reauthenticate

For all of the M365-related challenges, you can use this same container for all the associated tasks in this group. If your container does not seem to be able to authenticate, please wait some time -- perhaps Microsoft might not like multiple logins at the same time ;)

Welcome to our hackable M365 tenant! Can you find any juicy details, like perhaps the street address this organization is associated with?
