Description: 

We saw some communication to a sketchy site... here's an export of the network traffic. Can you track it down?

Some tools like rita or zeek might help dig through all of this data!

Solution 1: 

1. Install Rita on Remnux: https://github.com/activecm/rita
2. Extract traffic.7z to indidivudal logs in .gz (extract them all to raw .log)
3. Move all logs to a folder ~/CTF/huntressctf2023/forensics/traffic/
4. Enter that directory
5. Load logs into Rita and generate a report for viewing
6. Import logs to Rita: 
	a. "rita import . traffic" (. denotes all files in current directory, traffic is the name of the database to store data in)
7. Generate an html report for easy viewing
	a. "rita html-report traffic"
8. Look through the DNS tab to see web traffic
	a. sketchysite.github.io is listed
9. Curl website (or visit if this is a safe VM)
	a. curl -L https://sketchysite.github.io
	b. find flag: flag{8626fe7dcd8d412a80d0b3f0e36afd4a}

Solution 2:

1. Move to the directory with all of the logs extracted
2. "grep -R sketch"
3. curl -L https://sketchysite.github.io
	a.find flag: flag{8626fe7dcd8d412a80d0b3f0e36afd4a}
